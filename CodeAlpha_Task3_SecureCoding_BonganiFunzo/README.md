## Task Overview
This task demonstrates how to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in Python code.

### Vulnerable Code: [`vulnerable_script.py`](./vulnerable_script.py)
The original script had the following critical issues:
1. **Hardcoded credentials** â€” Exposes sensitive data in plain text.
2. **Use of `eval()`** â€” Allows execution of arbitrary Python code.
3. **Unvalidated file access** â€” Could lead to directory traversal attacks.
4. **Unrestricted `os.system()`** â€” Vulnerable to command injection.

## Fixed Version: [`secure_script.py`](./secure_script.py)
All vulnerabilities have been addressed:
| Issue                 | Fix                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials | Replaced with secure input using `getpass`            |
| `eval()` usage        | Replaced with `ast.literal_eval()` and numeric checks |
| File access           | Restricted to a safe folder with filename validation  |
| Command injection     | Used `subprocess.run()` with command whitelist        |

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Create a folder called `files` and place `.txt` files for testing file access.
3. Run `secure_script.py` and follow the prompts.
